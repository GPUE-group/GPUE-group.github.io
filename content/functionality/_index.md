GPUE is a general-purpose BEC simulator and can be used for a number of different superfluid simulations.
The basic usage of GPUE will be described here, including:

1. Basic usage of GPUE for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional simulations
2. Gauge fields in 2 and 3 dimensions
3. Vortex tracking in 2 dimensions
4. Dynamic fields and equation parsing
